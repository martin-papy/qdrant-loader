# Release Notes

## Version 0.7.0 - Sept 03, 2025

### LLM Provider-Agnostic Configuration & Migration

- BETA: Added Azure OpenAI support (no more 404s from misconfigured endpoints) and robust Ollama endpoint handling
- Introduced unified `global.llm.*` configuration controlling provider, `base_url`, models, tokenizer, request policy, rate limits, and `embeddings.vector_size`.
- Legacy fields (`global.embedding.*` and `file_conversion.markitdown.*`) remain supported with deprecation warnings; migration is recommended.
- Vector size is now read from config; hardcoded `1536` defaults replaced with config-driven values and a deprecated fallback warning when unspecified.
- Structured logging added for LLM requests (provider, operation, model, latency; secrets redacted) and normalized exception mapping across providers.
- Documentation updated with the new schema and env vars:
  - Azure logs label provider as `azure_openai`; OpenAI as `openai`; Ollama logs include latency for chat.
  - Clear error when Azure `base_url` includes `/openai/deployments/...`; requires `api_version`.
  - Ollama auto-detects `/v1` vs native. Native tries batch `/api/embed` first, falls back to `/api/embeddings`.
- Documentation updated with the new schema and env vars:
  - Configuration reference: `docs/users/configuration/config-file-reference.md`
  - Environment variables: `docs/users/configuration/environment-variables.md`

### Massive Codebase Refactor

- Centralized LLM layer in `qdrant-loader-core` with provider adapters (OpenAI / OpenAI-compatible via `base_url`, Ollama native or `/v1`).
- Removed direct OpenAI imports from application code; apps now use a provider factory from the core package.
- MCP server now prefers config file loading with CLI/env/file precedence and redacted `--print-config`; legacy env-only mode warns.
- Replaced hardcoded vector-size usage across components with configuration-driven values.
- Updated tests and documentation to align with provider-agnostic architecture.

## Version 0.6.1 - August 13, 2025

  - **Solution**: Escaped dash character to create valid pattern: `r"^[|\-\s:]+$"`
  - **Impact**: Excel files no longer fall back to default chunking strategy
- **Fixed large table chunking logic**: Resolved issue where large Excel tables were treated as single massive chunks
  - **Problem**: 128K character files created only 2-5 chunks instead of ~200 chunks at 600-character limit
  - **Root cause**: Large logical units (tables) were not split when exceeding max_size
  - **Solution**: Added intelligent splitting logic that preserves table structure while respecting chunk size limits
  - **Result**: Large Excel files now properly chunk into appropriate sizes (e.g., 74K chars ‚Üí 127 chunks @ ~588 chars each)
- **Eliminated token limit warnings**: Fixed the `Content exceeds maximum token limit, truncating` warnings that occurred with large Excel chunks
