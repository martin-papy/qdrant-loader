  # Controls how documents are split into chunks for processing
  chunking:

  # Default embedding configuration
  # Controls how text is converted to vectors
  embedding:
    endpoint: "https://api.openai.com/v1" # Optionnal. Defines the endpoint to use for embedding. Defaults to OpenAI endpoint.
    model: "text-embedding-3-small"  # Embedding model to use. Could be BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (exemple for local use) or text-embedding-3-small (for OpenAI use)

    vector_size: 1536                # Optionnal. Vector size for the embedding model (384 for BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, 1536 for OpenAI models)
    tokenizer: "cl100k_base"         # Optionnal. Tokenizer to use for token counting. Use 'cl100k_base' for OpenAI models or 'none' for other models.

  # Controls how document ingestion state is tracked
