# Metrics System Improvement Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the improvements to be made to the metrics tracking system in `qdrant_loader/core/monitoring/ingestion_metrics.py`. The goal is to enhance the metrics collection and reporting capabilities to better track processing performance and provide more detailed insights.

## Current State

- Basic metrics tracking for individual operations and batches
- Simple JSON file-based storage
- Limited processing rate and performance metrics
- Basic batch statistics

## Target State

- Comprehensive processing rate metrics
- Detailed batch statistics
- Hierarchical data structure
- Structured JSON output
- On-demand calculation of statistics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Structure Updates ✅

0. Update ingestion_metrics.py ✅
   - Split the file to hold 1 class per file ✅
   - Update the monitoring package accordingly and create the corresponding __init__.py file ✅

1. Create new data classes (each class should be in its own file): ✅
   - `ProcessingStats` for rate-related metrics ✅
   - `BatchSummary` for comprehensive statistics ✅
   - Update `BatchMetrics` to include summary field ✅

2. Update JSON serialization: ✅
   - Implement custom JSON encoder for new data structures ✅
   - Create structured output format with separate sections ✅

### Phase 2: Processing Rate Metrics (Partially Complete)

1. Implement overall processing rate calculation ✅
2. Add per-source rate tracking ✅
3. Add per-chunk rate tracking ✅
4. Implement time-based rate tracking with 5-second windows ✅
5. Add size-based rate tracking (Pending)

### Phase 3: Batch Statistics (Complete) ✅

1. Implement basic statistics: ✅
   - Total documents and chunks ✅
   - Average document size ✅
   - Success/failure rates ✅

2. Implement distribution statistics: ✅
   - Size distribution (min, max, median, mean) ✅
   - Chunk distribution (min, max, median, mean) ✅

3. Implement source-specific statistics: ✅
   - Per-source document counts ✅
   - Per-source processing rates ✅
   - Per-source success rates ✅

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Pending)

1. Update `save_metrics()` to use new structure ✅
2. Add unit tests for new functionality
3. Add integration tests for full workflow
4. Update documentation

## Success Criteria

- All new metrics are correctly calculated and stored ✅
- JSON output is properly structured and readable ✅
- Processing rates are accurate and useful ✅
- Batch statistics provide meaningful insights ✅
- No performance degradation during normal operation (Pending)

## Future Considerations

- Add visualization capabilities
- Implement metric aggregation across multiple runs
- Add export options for different formats
- Consider real-time monitoring capabilities
