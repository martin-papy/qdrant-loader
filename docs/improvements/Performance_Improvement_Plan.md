# Qdrant Loader Performance Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document presents a revised and aggressive plan to make the Qdrant Loader ingestion process **blazing fast**. Recent profiling and logs show that while some parallelism and batching have been introduced, the system is still bottlenecked by sequential stages, lack of deep pipeline parallelism, and insufficient caching. This plan introduces new strategies—pipeline parallelism, adaptive batching, aggressive caching, and resource-aware scheduling—to maximize throughput and efficiency while maintaining reliability and data integrity.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Key Components

1. **Ingestion Pipeline** (`IngestionPipeline` class)
   - Manages the overall document processing flow
   - Coordinates between different services
   - Handles state management and error handling

2. **Document Processing**
   - Sequential or batch processing of documents
   - Individual chunking, embedding, and upserting
   - State tracking for each document

3. **State Management**
   - SQLite-based state tracking
   - Individual state updates for each document
   - Change detection for incremental updates

## Performance Bottlenecks (as of May 2025)

1. **Stage-by-Stage Sequential Processing**
   - Chunking, embedding, and upsert are not fully decoupled; each batch waits for all documents to finish chunking before embedding, and so on.
   - Large files with many chunks slow down the pipeline.

2. **Limited Parallelism**
   - Parallelism is only at the batch level, not at the pipeline or per-document stage.
   - No use of process pools for CPU-bound chunking.

3. **No Aggressive Caching**
   - Embeddings, chunking results, and state are recomputed even for unchanged content.
   - No persistent or distributed cache.

4. **No Fast-Path for Unchanged Documents**
   - All documents are reprocessed even if their content and state are unchanged.

5. **Static Batch Sizes**
   - Batch sizes are fixed and do not adapt to system load or downstream service latency.

6. **No Backpressure or Resource-Aware Scheduling**
   - The system does not throttle or adapt based on CPU, memory, or network utilization.

7. **Limited Monitoring and Profiling**
   - No flamegraph/profiling support for pinpointing slow spots.
   - Metrics are basic and not exposed for real-time observability.

## Revised Improvement Strategies

### 1. Pipeline Parallelism (Deep Async Pipeline)

- **Decouple chunking, embedding, and upsert** using asyncio queues. Each stage runs in parallel, and bottlenecks are isolated.
- **Maximize parallelism at every stage:**
  - **Chunking:** Use ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor to process multiple documents in parallel, especially for CPU-bound chunking strategies.
  - **Embedding:** Use asyncio tasks or batch API calls to embed multiple chunks concurrently.
  - **Upsert:** Batch and upsert points in parallel where possible.
- **Eliminate sequential processing:** Only process sequentially where strictly necessary for correctness or resource constraints.
- **Example:**

```python
async def pipeline_ingest(self, documents: list[Document]):
    chunk_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    embedding_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    upsert_queue = asyncio.Queue()

    # Producer: chunk documents
    async def chunker():
        for doc in documents:
            for chunk in self.chunking_service.chunk(doc):
                await chunk_queue.put(chunk)
        await chunk_queue.put(None)  # Sentinel

    # Middle: embed chunks
    async def embedder():
        while True:
            chunk = await chunk_queue.get()
            if chunk is None:
                await embedding_queue.put(None)
                break
            embedding = await self.embedding_service.get_embedding(chunk.content)
            await embedding_queue.put((chunk, embedding))

    # Consumer: upsert to Qdrant
    async def upserter():
        while True:
            item = await embedding_queue.get()
            if item is None:
                break
            chunk, embedding = item
            point = self._create_point(chunk, embedding)
            await self.qdrant_manager.upsert_points([point])

    await asyncio.gather(chunker(), embedder(), upserter())
```

### 2. Aggressive Caching (Embeddings, State, Chunking)

- **Persistent embedding cache** (disk-backed LRU or Redis) keyed by content hash.
- **State cache** to skip unchanged documents at the earliest possible stage.
- **Chunk cache** for unchanged files.
- **Cache invalidation** on content/state change.

### 3. Adaptive Batching and Backpressure

- **Dynamic batch size**: Monitor Qdrant/OpenAI response times and system load, and adjust batch sizes in real time.
- **Backpressure**: If Qdrant or embedding API slows, slow down upstream processing.

### 4. Fast-Path for Unchanged Documents

- **Skip all processing** for documents whose content hash and state are unchanged.
- **Early exit** in the pipeline for such documents.

### 5. Resource-Aware Scheduling

- **Monitor CPU/memory/network** and throttle ingestion if system is overloaded.
- **Optionally use uvloop** for faster asyncio event loop.
- **Expose resource metrics** for observability.

### 6. Advanced Monitoring and Profiling

- **Integrate py-spy or similar** for flamegraph support.
- **Expose Prometheus metrics** for all pipeline stages (chunking, embedding, upsert, cache hit/miss, etc).
- **Track per-stage latency and throughput**.

### 7. Optional: Distributed/Clustered Processing

- For very large corpora, allow running multiple loader instances with work partitioning.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins

- [x] Implement pipeline parallelism with asyncio queues for chunking, embedding, and upsert.
- [x] Replace legacy pipeline with async pipeline as the default and only option, providing blazing fast performance for all users.
- [~] Persistent embedding and state cache: **Not needed for current usage.**
  - State change detection is already robustly handled by StateManager.
  - Persistent embedding cache is unnecessary unless duplicate content or frequent restarts become an issue. If this changes, revisit with a lightweight or persistent cache.
- [x] Skip unchanged documents at the earliest possible stage.  
  - This is handled by StateManager and StateChangeDetector, which filter out unchanged documents before ingestion. The async pipeline receives only changed/new documents, so this fast-path is already in effect for both pipelines.
- [x] Add basic resource monitoring and log warnings if overloaded.

### Phase 2: Optimization (Actionable Steps)

- [x] **Refactor chunking to use ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor for parallel document chunking.**
  - Chunking is now truly parallelized in the async pipeline using ThreadPoolExecutor, allowing multiple documents to be chunked concurrently for improved throughput.
- [x] **Implement async embedding batcher:**
  - Embedding is now batched and processed concurrently in the async pipeline. Each embedder worker collects a batch of chunks and calls the embedding service's batch method, maximizing throughput and efficiency.
- [x] **Parallelize upsert operations:**
  - Upserts are now batched and processed concurrently in the async pipeline. Each upserter worker collects a batch of (chunk, embedding) pairs and upserts them together, maximizing throughput and efficiency.
- [ ] **Adaptive batch sizing:**
  - Monitor real-time metrics (latency, throughput, resource usage).
  - Dynamically adjust batch sizes for chunking, embedding, and upsert.
- [ ] **Implement backpressure and queueing:**
  - Throttle upstream stages if downstream services (Qdrant, embedding API) slow down.
  - Use asyncio queues with maxsize and flow control.
- [ ] **Profile pipeline and optimize hot spots:**
  - Use py-spy, cProfile, or similar tools to identify slowest functions.
  - Optimize or parallelize bottleneck functions.
- [ ] **Expose Prometheus metrics for all stages:**
  - Add metrics endpoints for chunking, embedding, upsert, cache hit/miss, etc.
  - Track per-stage latency, throughput, and error rates.

### Phase 3: Advanced/Optional (Actionable Steps)

- [ ] **Enable distributed ingestion:**
  - Partition work and allow multiple loader instances to run in parallel.
  - Implement coordination (e.g., via database, message queue, or distributed lock).
- [ ] **Implement advanced caching strategies:**
  - Prefetch and cache embeddings/chunks for likely-to-be-reingested content.
  - Implement cache warming and eviction policies.
- [ ] **Automated optimization suggestions:**
  - Analyze metrics and suggest configuration changes (batch size, concurrency, etc.) automatically.
  - Alert on performance regressions or resource issues.
