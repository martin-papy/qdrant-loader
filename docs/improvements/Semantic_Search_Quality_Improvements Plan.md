# Semantic Search Quality Improvements Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to improve semantic search quality in our Qdrant database by enhancing how we process and chunk documents before ingestion. The goal is to make the content more semantically rich and interconnected, which should improve search results even with general queries.

## Current Limitations

1. **Document Creation** ✅
   - Basic metadata only (file type, Git info) - Implemented
   - No semantic context - Implemented through chunking strategies
   - Limited title handling - Improved with connector-specific handling
   - No content summarization - Implemented in chunking strategies
   - Unclear separation of responsibilities between Document and connectors - Resolved

2. **Chunking Strategy** ✅
   - Section-based splitting - Implemented in MarkdownChunkingStrategy
   - Basic header preservation - Implemented with header hierarchy
   - Limited context between chunks - Improved with overlap and context preservation
   - No semantic relationships - Implemented through chunk metadata
   - Unclear separation between base and specific strategies - Resolved

3. **Search Results** 🔄
   - Low relevance scores for general queries - In progress
   - Missing important context - Improved with enhanced chunking
   - Poor semantic understanding - In progress
