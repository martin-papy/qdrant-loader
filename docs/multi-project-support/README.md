# Multi-Project Support Documentation

**Issue**: [#20](https://github.com/martin-papy/qdrant-loader/issues/20)  
**Status**: In Development  
**Target Release**: v0.4.0b1

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the multi-project support feature in QDrant Loader. This major enhancement allows users to manage multiple projects using a single configuration file, one QDrant server, and one MCP server instance.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Resource Efficiency**: Single infrastructure for multiple projects
- **Operational Simplicity**: One configuration file and server to manage
- **Flexible Search**: Project-specific or cross-project search capabilities
- **Organizational Clarity**: Clear project boundaries and metadata

## 📖 Configuration Examples

### Legacy Configuration (Still Supported)

```yaml
global:
  qdrant:
    collection_name: "documents"
sources:
  git:
    my-repo:
      base_url: "https://github.com/user/repo.git"
```

### New Multi-Project Configuration

```yaml
global:
  qdrant:
    collection_name: "documents"
projects:
  project-alpha:
    display_name: "Project Alpha - Customer Portal"
    description: "Customer-facing portal documentation"
    sources:
      git:
        frontend-repo:
          base_url: "https://github.com/company/alpha-frontend.git"
      confluence:
        alpha-space:
          space_key: "ALPHA"
          # ... other confluence config
  
  project-beta:
    display_name: "Project Beta - Internal Tools"
    description: "Internal tooling documentation"
    sources:
      git:
        tools-repo:
          base_url: "https://github.com/company/beta-tools.git"
```

## 🔧 New CLI Commands

```bash
# Project management
qdrant-loader projects list                    # List all projects
qdrant-loader projects status                  # Status of all projects
qdrant-loader projects info --project alpha   # Project details

# Project-specific operations
qdrant-loader ingest --project alpha          # Ingest specific project
qdrant-loader status --project alpha          # Project-specific status
```

## 🔍 Enhanced MCP Server Tools

### Project-Filtered Search

```json
{
  "name": "search",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "authentication implementation",
    "project_ids": ["project-alpha", "project-beta"],
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

### Project Management

```json
{
  "name": "list_projects",
  "arguments": {}
}
```
