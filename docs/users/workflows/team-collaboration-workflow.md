# Team Collaboration Workflow

This comprehensive guide shows how to implement effective team collaboration workflows using QDrant Loader for cross-team knowledge sharing, streamlined onboarding, and collaborative documentation systems. Whether you're managing knowledge across multiple teams, onboarding new team members, or facilitating cross-functional collaboration, this workflow provides practical solutions using QDrant Loader's actual capabilities.

## üéØ Overview

The team collaboration workflow focuses on breaking down knowledge silos, facilitating information sharing across teams, and creating efficient onboarding processes. This workflow is essential for organizations that need to maintain shared knowledge bases and enable effective collaboration across different departments and teams.

### Workflow Benefits

```text
ü§ù Cross-Team Knowledge - Shared understanding across departments
üöÄ Faster Onboarding - Streamlined new team member integration
üîç Knowledge Discovery - Easy access to expertise and information
üìä Collaboration Metrics - Track knowledge sharing effectiveness
üéØ Reduced Silos - Break down departmental barriers
```

   \`\`\`bash
   cp cursor-mcp-config.json ~/.cursor/mcp_settings.json
   \`\`\`
2. Update the API keys in the configuration file
3. Restart Cursor IDE
4. The QDrant Loader tools will be available in Cursor

## Setup for Claude Desktop
1. Copy the configuration to Claude Desktop's config directory:

   **macOS:**
   \`\`\`bash
   cp claude-desktop-config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   \`\`\`

   **Linux:**
   \`\`\`bash
   cp claude-desktop-config.json ~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   \`\`\`

### Step 3: Knowledge Management and Collaboration

#### 3.1 Daily Collaboration Tasks

```bash
# Update team knowledge base
qdrant-loader ingest --workspace .

# Update specific team project
qdrant-loader ingest --workspace . --project product-team

# Check project status
qdrant-loader config --workspace .

# Validate all projects
qdrant-loader config --workspace .
```

#### 3.2 Weekly Team Operations

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/weekly-team-sync.sh - Weekly team knowledge synchronization
set -euo pipefail

WORKSPACE_DIR="${WORKSPACE_DIR:-$(pwd)}"

echo "Starting weekly team knowledge synchronization..."

# Update all team projects
echo "Updating shared knowledge..."
qdrant-loader ingest --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" --project shared-knowledge

echo "Updating product team knowledge..."
qdrant-loader ingest --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" --project product-team

echo "Updating engineering team knowledge..."
qdrant-loader ingest --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" --project engineering-team

echo "Updating design team knowledge..."
qdrant-loader ingest --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" --project design-team

# Check status of all projects
echo ""
echo "Project status summary:"
qdrant-loader config --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Weekly team knowledge synchronization completed!"
```

#### 3.3 Monthly Knowledge Review

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/monthly-knowledge-review.sh - Monthly knowledge base review
set -euo pipefail

WORKSPACE_DIR="${WORKSPACE_DIR:-$(pwd)}"
REVIEW_DIR="${REVIEW_DIR:-./reviews}"

echo "Starting monthly knowledge review..."

# Create review directory
mkdir -p "$REVIEW_DIR/$(date +%Y-%m)"

# Generate project status report
echo "Generating project status report..."
qdrant-loader config --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" --format json > "$REVIEW_DIR/$(date +%Y-%m)/project-status.json"

# List all projects
echo "Generating project list..."
qdrant-loader config --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" --format json > "$REVIEW_DIR/$(date +%Y-%m)/project-list.json"

# Create summary report
cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/$(date +%Y-%m)/monthly-review.md" << EOF
# Monthly Knowledge Review - $(date +%B\ %Y)

## Project Overview

### Active Projects
$(qdrant-loader config --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" | grep -E "^‚îÇ" | head -n -1 | tail -n +2 || echo "No projects found")

### Project Status
$(qdrant-loader config --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR")

## Key Metrics
- **Total Projects**: $(qdrant-loader config --workspace "$WORKSPACE_DIR" --format json | jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
- **Review Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
- **Review Period**: $(date +%B\ %Y)

## Action Items
- [ ] Review project configurations
- [ ] Update outdated documentation
- [ ] Plan knowledge sharing sessions
- [ ] Address any configuration issues

## Next Steps
1. Share review with team leads
2. Plan improvements for next month
3. Schedule knowledge sharing sessions
4. Update team onboarding materials
