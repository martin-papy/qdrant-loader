# Workspace Mode Configuration

This guide covers how to configure QDrant Loader for different workspace scenarios, from single projects to complex multi-project team environments. Workspace mode determines how QDrant Loader organizes and manages your data across different projects and contexts.

## üéØ Overview

Workspace mode in QDrant Loader allows you to organize your knowledge base according to your project structure and team needs. Whether you're working on a single project, managing multiple projects, or collaborating with a team, the right workspace configuration ensures optimal organization and searchability.

### Workspace Types

```
üìÅ Single Project    - One project, one collection
üìÅ Multi-Project     - Multiple projects, organized collections
üìÅ Team Workspace    - Shared team knowledge with access control
üìÅ Hybrid Workspace  - Mix of personal and shared collections
```

## üèóÔ∏è Single Project Workspace

### Basic Single Project Setup

Perfect for individual developers or small teams working on one main project.

```yaml
# qdrant-loader.yaml - Single project configuration
workspace:
  mode: "single"
  name: "my-awesome-project"
  
qdrant:
  url: "http://localhost:6333"
  collection_name: "my_awesome_project_docs"
  
data_sources:
  git:
    repositories:
      - url: "https://github.com/company/my-awesome-project"
        branch: "main"
        include_patterns:
          - "docs/**"
          - "*.md"
          - "README*"
  
  confluence:
    base_url: "https://company.atlassian.net"
    username: "user@company.com"
    api_token: "${CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN}"
    spaces: ["PROJ"]

processing:
  chunk_size: 1000
  chunk_overlap: 200
  metadata:
    project: "my-awesome-project"
    workspace: "single"
```

### Single Project with Multiple Sources

```yaml
# qdrant-loader.yaml - Single project with multiple data sources
workspace:
  mode: "single"
  name: "documentation-hub"
  description: "Central documentation for our main product"
  
qdrant:
  url: "http://localhost:6333"
  collection_name: "documentation_hub"
  
data_sources:
  # Main project repository
  git:
    repositories:
      - url: "https://github.com/company/main-product"
        branch: "main"
        name: "main-repo"
        include_patterns:
          - "docs/**"
          - "*.md"
          - "api/**/*.yaml"
      
      # Documentation repository
      - url: "https://github.com/company/product-docs"
        branch: "main"
        name: "docs-repo"
        include_patterns:
          - "**/*.md"
          - "**/*.rst"
  
  # Confluence documentation
  confluence:

    username: "${CONFLUENCE_USERNAME}"
    api_token: "${CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN}"
    spaces: ["DOCS", "API", "GUIDES"]
  
  # JIRA for requirements and issues
  jira:
    base_url: "https://company.atlassian.net"
    username: "${JIRA_USERNAME}"
    api_token: "${JIRA_API_TOKEN}"
    projects: ["PROD"]
    settings:
      issue_types: ["Story", "Epic", "Bug"]
      include_comments: true

    workspace: "single"
    tags:
      - "documentation"
      - "main-product"
```

## üè¢ Multi-Project Workspace

### Basic Multi-Project Setup

Ideal for teams managing multiple related projects with separate but connected knowledge bases.
